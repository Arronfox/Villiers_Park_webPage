  I had a very brief coursework in maths as part of the C3 module.<br>
  We investigating differnt numerical methods and how we could use them to solve equations. The three methods we used were the change of sign method, the Newton-Rapshon method and the x = g(x) mehtod.<br>
  We used autograph graphing caculator to allow us to plot graphs and excel to allow us to us to store the results and solve the equations.
