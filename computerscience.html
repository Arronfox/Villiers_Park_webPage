  <p>In computer science i am creating a video game using unity engine and scripts in C#.<br>
  The game will be a 2-D platformer including three different enemy types, three lifes, a points system and a leaderboard to display times and points collected.<br>
  I will be using a complex OOP structure, a range of data structures such as stacks, queues & linked lists and i will have the files organised for direct access.
