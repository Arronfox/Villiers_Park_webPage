  <p>In computer science i am creating a video game using unity engine and scripts in C#.<br>
  The game will be a 2-D platformer including three different enemy types, three lifes, a points system and a leaderboard to display times and points collected.<br>
  I will be using a complex OOP structure, a range of data structures such as stacks, queues & linked lists and i will have the files organised for direct access.</p>

  In the picture above you can see the Unity Engine user interface with an instance of my game running.<br>
  I have multiple scripts controlling multiple aspects of the game such as controlling the character, the animations and the enemies.<br>
  I also use some in game components such as RigidBody2D and box colliders. These can be used in conjuction to create an object that obeys the in game physics and can collide and react correctly.
